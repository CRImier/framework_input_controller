This repository currently contains test code for hardware verification and lasercutting files for the keyboard backing.
Later on, it will contain fully featured firmware files.

The `drawing.svg` file contains middle layer lasercutting drawings - the bottom layer is cleaner and doesn't have to have as many holes.
To make the lasercut backing bottom layer, you'll want to edit the `drawing.svg` file, removing a bunch of stuff that only needs to be cut on the middle layer.
It was measured with calipers, thus, expect imprecisions.

PCB files are [available here.](https://github.com/CRImier/MyKiCad/tree/master/Laptop%20mods/framework_input_controller)
